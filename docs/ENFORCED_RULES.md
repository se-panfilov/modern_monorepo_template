# Enforced rules

Tools check part of the rules in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and the documents in `docs/`.
The checks are the same for each person and each AI agent, because they use only repository files, Git, and GitHub Actions.
They do not use vendor-specific agent hooks.

Cloud agents work in a new clone. Local Git hooks are not installed there, because `npm ci --ignore-scripts` does not install them.
For this reason, CI repeats each hook check. Branch protection on GitHub is the last control.

The package rules apply to each package in `packages/`. See [the workspace layout](WORKSPACES.md).

## ESLint

The shared [configuration](../configs/eslint.config.mjs) has these project rules in addition to the recommended JavaScript and TypeScript rules.

| Rule                                                                                                       | Source                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| No `exec` or `execSync` import, and no `shell` option except `false`.                                      | AGENTS.md, Security          |
| Node.js built-in modules use the `node:` prefix.                                                           | AGENTS.md, Implementation    |
| Strings, template literals, test names, and code comments have no Cyrillic text.                           | AGENTS.md, Documentation     |
| A package imports only its own `@<directory>/*` alias. Source modules do not use relative imports.         | AGENTS.md, Implementation    |
| A package does not import the source of another package. It uses a workspace dependency and exports.       | WORKSPACES.md                |
| No property setters, no `arguments`, and at most two `Object.assign` arguments.                            | Project code style           |
| Sorted imports and exports. Type-only imports use type markers. Functions have return types.               | Project code style           |
| Type-aware `recommendedTypeChecked` rules for package TypeScript, `strictTypeChecked` for `src/`.          | Project code style, Security |
| Vue files: `flat/recommended` Vue rules, `<script lang="ts">`, `<script setup>`, no `v-html`, typed `ref`. | AGENTS.md, Implementation    |

The configuration reads `packages/` and makes the alias rules for each package directory. A new package gets these rules without a configuration change.
The self-import rule reads the package name from `package.json`, because each project selects its own npm scope.
The selectors check direct static code. They do not follow aliases, dynamic property names, or `require` calls. They do not establish an execution boundary.

## Configuration check

`npm run check:config` runs [scripts/ci/config.mjs](../scripts/ci/config.mjs). The `repository` job in Tests runs it too.

| Area             | Check                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base tsconfig    | The required compiler options are present with the documented values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Package tsconfig | It extends the Node.js base or the Vue base. It sets only `rootDir: "."`, `outDir: "dist"`, and `paths`. The only alias is `@<directory>/*` → `./src/*.ts`, or `./src/*` in a Vue package, which also includes `src/**/*.vue`.                                                                                                                                        |
| Aliases          | Vite and Vitest resolve `@<directory>` to the package `src/` directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Package metadata | `private: true`, `description`, `license`, `type: "module"`, `engines` equal to the root, `exports`, `README.md`, and the `build`, `typecheck`, `test`, `lint`, and `format:check` scripts. A CLI has one bin entry, a `start` script with the same entry, and a shebang.                                                                                             |
| Dependencies     | Runtime dependencies are in `runtimeDependencyAllowlist`. Packages have no devDependencies. Root devDependencies use exact versions. No installation hooks.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Lockfile         | The package version agrees with `package-lock.json`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Structure        | Uppercase rule file names, rule files only in the root, no tracked `dist/`, one lockfile, no shell scripts outside `shellScriptAllowlist`, equal skill adapter descriptions, no tracked images, media, archives, or model weights outside `binaryAssetAllowlist`, and no agent host settings or override instruction files outside `hostConfigAllowlist`.             |
| Language         | Tracked text files have no Cyrillic text. Vendored skills, skill patches, provenance data, and lockfiles are not checked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Workflows        | Read-only top-level `permissions`, no `write-all`, actions pinned to full SHAs with a version comment, `persist-credentials: false` for checkout, no `${{ }}` in `run`, and no `pull_request_target`, `workflow_run`, `issue_comment`, `pull_request_review`, `pull_request_review_comment`, `discussion`, or `discussion_comment` event, in key, list, or flow form. |
| Skills           | Each third-party skill file in `.agents/skills` has the SHA-256 value from `docs/skill-provenance.json`. `allowed-tools` contains only tools from `skillToolAllowlist`. SKILL.md has no `hooks` field and no pre-prompt command. Links in `.claude/skills` point to `.agents/skills`.                                                                                 |
| Node.js version  | `.nvmrc` contains an exact version `X.Y.Z`. The root `engines.node` is `>=` the same version.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The workflow check reads the line structure of the workflow files. It is not a complete YAML parser.
Agent host settings and override instruction files are `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.mcp.json`, `.gemini/settings.json`, `.codex/config.toml`, `.cursor/`, `.idea/watcherTasks.xml` (WebStorm File Watchers), `.junie/mcp/` (Junie MCP servers), `AGENTS.override.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, `GEMINI.local.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, and `.clinerules` (a file or a directory). The check ignores letter case, because the macOS file system is case-insensitive.
These files can run commands, grant tool permissions, start MCP servers, or replace the rules in AGENTS.md. A pull request can add them, and an agent can load them before a human reads them.
The structure and language checks read the files that Git tracks. Stage new files before you run the check.

## Git hooks

Install the hooks with `npm run hooks:install`. See [Git hooks and secret checks](GIT_HOOKS.md).

| Hook       | Check                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| pre-commit | No commit on `master` or `main`. Staged files are formatted. No secrets in the staged changes.        |
| commit-msg | No link to an AI agent thread, chat, session, or task. No session trailer, such as `Claude-Session:`. |
| pre-push   | No push to `master` or `main`.                                                                        |

[scripts/ci/rules.mjs](../scripts/ci/rules.mjs) contains the shared list of host names and path prefixes. The list covers known services. It cannot find every possible link.

## Pull request rules

The `pr-rules` job in the [PR rules workflow](../.github/workflows/pr-rules.yml) runs [scripts/ci/pr-rules.mjs](../scripts/ci/pr-rules.mjs) on each pull request.
It runs again when the title or description changes. Tests do not run again for that change.

1. The branch name is `<type>/<short_description>`. The type is `feature`, `bugfix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, or `chore`. The description has lowercase letters and digits, with `_` between words.
2. The description starts with `## tl;dr`. HTML comments and one italic attribution line can come before it. The `## Changes` and `## Verification` sections are present.
3. The title, the description, and each commit message have no AI agent session links or session trailers.
4. A change to files in `packages/<directory>/` outside `test/` requires one version step: patch, minor, or major. A skipped or reduced version is an error.
5. New or changed packages in `package-lock.json` come from `https://registry.npmjs.org/` with a `sha512` integrity value. A new install script requires a human review. The job lists the changed packages and runs `npm audit --package-lock-only --audit-level=high`.

## Limits

These checks do not replace a review. They find known patterns and structure problems.
They do not check the project data formats, content rules, licenses of external tools, or provenance records. Those rules need a human review or a project-specific validator.
A person or an agent can bypass local hooks. Required status checks and branch rules on GitHub prevent a merge without the CI checks. The repository owner configures them.
